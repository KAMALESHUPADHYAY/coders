                <b>Scientists: Scientists use weather forecasts to study the atmosphere and climate.</b><br>

Approach:As these trends continue to develop, we can expect weather forecasts to become increasingly accurate and reliable. This will have a significant impact on a wide range of industries and activities..
<br>
Outcome: The One-Child Policy successfully slowed population growth but resulted in gender imbalances and an aging population. The shift to a Two-Child Policy aimed to address these issues and encourage population growth, yet the impact has been limited due to cultural and economic factors influencing family planning decisions.<br>
<b>Military: Weather forecasts are used by the military to plan for and carry out military operations.<br>

</b>

Approach: India has a long-standing family planning program aiming to provide contraceptives and reproductive health services. In recent years, there's been an emphasis on improving education, especially for women, to empower them to make informed decisions about family size.
<br>
Outcome:Outcomes of sustainability development represent the tangible and intangible results achieved through efforts to promote environmental protection, social equity, economic prosperity, and overall well-being while preserving resources for future generations.
